# Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring

## Objective

This project develops a real-time data processing system that monitors weather conditions and provides summarized insights using rollups and aggregates. It retrieves data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) and focuses on key weather parameters.

## Data Source

The system continuously retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. You will need to sign up for a free API key to access the data. The API provides various weather parameters, including:

- **main**: Main weather condition (e.g., Rain, Snow, Clear)
- **temp**: Current temperature in Centigrade
- **feels_like**: Perceived temperature in Centigrade
- **dt**: Time of the data update (Unix timestamp)

## Processing and Analysis

The system will:

- Continuously call the OpenWeatherMap API at a configurable interval (e.g., every 5 minutes) to retrieve real-time weather data for major metros in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad).
- For each received weather update, convert temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius.

## Rollups and Aggregates

### 1. Daily Weather Summary
- Roll up the weather data for each day.
- Calculate daily aggregates for:
  - Average temperature
  - Maximum temperature
  - Minimum temperature
  - Dominant weather condition (based on frequency)
- Store the daily summaries in a database or persistent storage for further analysis.

### 2. Alerting Thresholds
- Define user-configurable thresholds for temperature or specific weather conditions (e.g., alert if temperature exceeds 35 degrees Celsius for two consecutive updates).
- Continuously track the latest weather data and compare it with the thresholds.
- Trigger alerts for the current weather conditions if a threshold is breached. Alerts could be displayed on the console or sent via an email notification system.

### 3. Implement Visualizations
- Display daily weather summaries, historical trends, and triggered alerts.

## Installation
  npm install for frontend
  node insatll for backend


  git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>

npm install express body-parser cors mysql2

npx create-react-app my-rule-engine-ui
cd my-rule-engine-ui
npm install axios react-router-dom
node index.js
npm start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-monitoring.git
   cd weather-monitoring
Install dependencies:


npm install
Set up the database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) and ensure it is running.

Configure your environment variables in a .env file:

env
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
Running the Project
To start the data processing system:


npm start
Usage
The system will automatically retrieve weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API at the configured interval.
Monitor the console for alerts based on temperature thresholds.
Access the database to view daily weather summaries and historical trends.
Test Cases
System Setup:

Verify the system starts successfully and connects to the OpenWeatherMap API using a valid API key.
Data Retrieval:

Simulate API calls at configurable intervals and ensure the system retrieves and parses weather data correctly for specified locations.
Temperature Conversion:

Test conversion of temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius (or Fahrenheit) based on user preference.
Daily Weather Summary:

Simulate a sequence of weather updates for several days and verify daily summaries are calculated correctly.
Alerting Thresholds:

Define and configure user thresholds for temperature or weather conditions. Simulate data breaches to verify alerts are triggered correctly.
Bonus Features
Extend the system to support additional weather parameters from the OpenWeatherMap API (e.g., humidity, wind speed) and incorporate them into rollups/aggregates.
Implement functionalities like retrieving weather forecasts and generating summaries based on predicted conditions.
Evaluation Criteria
Functionality and correctness of the real-time data processing system.
Accuracy of data parsing, temperature conversion, and rollup/aggregate calculations.
Efficiency of data retrieval and processing within acceptable intervals.
Completeness of test cases covering various weather scenarios and user configurations.
Clarity and maintainability of the codebase.
(Bonus) Implementation of additional features.
Artifacts to be Submitted
Codebase: Preferably a GitHub repository.
README: Comprehensive with build instructions, design choices, and dependencies for setting up and running the application (e.g., a web server, database, which can be Docker or Podman containers).

Using the Application
Access the backend API on http://localhost:<backend-port>/api/rules to manage rules.
Use the frontend at http://localhost:3000 to interact with the rule engine.



Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js
XAMPP (for MySQL) or Docker for containerization.
Installation Instructions
Clone the Repository: Clone your repository to your local machine.

git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
Install Backend Dependencies: Navigate to your backend directory (if applicable) and install the required packages.

npm install express axios node-schedule mysql2
Dependencies Explained:
express: Web framework for Node.js to create server applications.
axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
node-schedule: A cron-like library for scheduling tasks in Node.js.
mysql2: MySQL client for Node.js.
Setup the Database:

Start XAMPP and launch the phpMyAdmin.
Create a new database (e.g., weather_monitoring).
Define the necessary schema for your daily weather summaries. Hereâ€™s an example SQL command:

CREATE TABLE daily_weather_summary (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  average_temperature DECIMAL(5, 2) NOT NULL,
  max_temperature DECIMAL(5, 2) NOT NULL,
  min_temperature DECIMAL(5, 2) NOT NULL,
  dominant_weather_condition VARCHAR(50),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Obtain OpenWeatherMap API Key:

Sign up for a free account at OpenWeatherMap and obtain your API key. Store this key securely as it will be used to access weather data.
Configure Environment Variables: Create a .env file in your project root directory and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:

OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
Run the Application: Start your backend server (assuming you have an index.js or server.js file):

node index.js
Using the Application
The application will automatically call the OpenWeatherMap API at the specified interval (e.g., every 5 minutes) to retrieve weather data.
Daily weather summaries will be stored in the database for further analysis.
Test Cases
System Setup: Verify that the system connects to the OpenWeatherMap API using a valid API key.

Data Retrieval: Ensure that the system retrieves weather data for the specified locations and parses the response correctly.

Temperature Conversion: Test the conversion of temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius (or Fahrenheit).
